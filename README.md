# Checking-if-a-word-is-PALINDROME-or-not
PALINDROME WORD CHECKER:
The most favourable beginner friendly python program that everyone want to try, but the only resistance to this is confusion. Whether it be for the syntax or logic or difficulties in indentation or simply deciding which code will be the most PYTHONIC.

WHAT IS PALINDROME?
It is a word that spells the same when reversing its alphabets, i.e, it reads the same forward and backward.
FOR EXAMPLE:
PEEP
MADAM
LEVEL
RACECAR

Why palindrome itself is useful in programming?
Palindrome detection is used in:
✔ String manipulation learning (very common for beginners)
✔ Coding interviews (Every company asks string problems)
✔ Data cleaning (Checking symmetry in strings)
✔ Algorithms (Palindrome partitioning, Longest palindromic substring, DNA sequence analysis, File name validation systems)
✔ Competitive programming
Palindrome logic is a building block for many problems.
